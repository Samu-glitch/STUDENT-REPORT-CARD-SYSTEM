# STUDENT-REPORT-CARD-SYSTEM
The Student Report Card System is a C++ mini project designed to manage and display student academic records efficiently. It allows teachers or administrators to store, process, and analyze students’ marks in various subjects and automatically generate their report cards with total marks, percentage, and grades.
🧾 STUDENT REPORT CARD SYSTEM — Detailed Explanation

The Student Report Card System is a C++ mini project developed to automate the process of managing student academic records. It is a console-based application that helps teachers or school administrators handle student information more efficiently without the need for manual calculations or paperwork.

This project focuses on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to design a system that is structured, modular, and easy to maintain. Using classes and objects, the system stores student data such as roll number, name, and marks in multiple subjects, then processes these marks to calculate:

Total Marks

Average / Percentage

Grade or Result Status (Pass/Fail)

The program can display individual student report cards or all stored records in a tabular format, depending on user requirements.

🎯 Main Objectives

To digitalize and simplify the process of creating student report cards.

To demonstrate the power of Object-Oriented Programming in solving real-world problems.

To minimize manual errors in calculating total marks and grades.

To manage multiple student records efficiently.

⚙️ How the System Works

Data Input:
The teacher enters details such as student name, roll number, and marks in subjects (e.g., English, Math, Science, etc.).

Processing:
The system automatically calculates the total marks, average, and grade based on predefined conditions.
Example:

If percentage ≥ 90 → Grade A+

If percentage ≥ 80 → Grade A

If percentage ≥ 70 → Grade B

Otherwise → Grade C or Fail

Storage:
Student data can be temporarily stored in memory or permanently saved using file handling (optional part).
This allows the records to be retrieved even after the program closes.

Display:
The program displays an individual student’s report card with all the calculated details, or it can show all students’ reports in a list.

🧱 Features

Add new student records.

Display all student report cards.

Search for a student by roll number.

Calculate and assign grades automatically.

Store and retrieve data using file handling (if included).

Menu-driven interface (user-friendly).

💻 Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects

Functions

Constructors

Conditional Statements

Loops

File Handling (optional)

📈 Benefits

Eliminates human error in grading and calculations.

Saves time compared to manual report generation.

Easy to use and understand for beginners in programming.

Demonstrates fundamental programming and OOP concepts clearly.

🏁 Conclusion

The Student Report Card System project successfully demonstrates the use of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming to develop a simple yet effective academic management tool. It automates the grading and record-keeping process, reduces human effort, and enhances the accuracy of results.
This project can be further expanded into a complete Student Management System by integrating features like student attendance, subjects addition, and database storage.
